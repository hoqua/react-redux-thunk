# React redux-thunk example app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Demo

Autodeploy setted for heroku:  [demo link](https://hoqua-thunk.herokuapp.com/) 

### Important note

I've played around with IntersectionObserver and CSS Scroll Snap. It reduced number of image loads, added some caveats and is is not  really supported well. 
In any case try to build it localy from [stable commit](https://github.com/hoqua/react-redux-thunk/tree/4d70f8ea91984d4d16eff8dcd2a0f32fc0b574a6)
